set the modulation source of **time** to **clock** to sync a delay with norns' global clock at whole number intervals. setting **time a quant** or **time b quant** to **oct** locks **time** into whole-number multiples & divisions of the clock. play with time to add scattered, pitch-shifted fills.

**input:** plucked synthesizer arpeggio, synced to global clock

**key settings**
- clock tempo: 48bpm
- i/o: coupled
- range a: delay
- range b: delay
- time a: 0. increase to add fills
- time a quant: oct
- time b: 0.01
- time lag a: 3.00
- feedback a: 2.5
- modulation sources
  - time a: clock

**time** is animated especially well with stepped modulation â€“ coupling feedback to the same mod source adds to the effect. with crow connected, send in stepped voltages from a sequencer, keyboard, sample and hold module. alternatively, you can source modulation from a midi keyboard or an internal lfo with **shape** set to **random** and **lfo min**, **lfo max**, and **lfo depth** increased to add 3-6 volts of range to the output.

**key settings**
- i/o: coupled
- range a: delay
- range b: delay
- time a: -2
- time b: 0.01
- time lag a: 3.00
- feedback a: -1.7
- modulation sources
  - time a: crow, midi, or lfo
  - feedback a: same as time a
